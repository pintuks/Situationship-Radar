# Situationship Radar

Situationship Radar is a playful AI-powered web app that helps users decode mixed signals in modern dating chats.

Paste a conversation snippet and the app returns:
- a **Delulu Score** (how chaotic/unclear the vibe is),
- a set of **relationship signal breakdowns**,
- **meme-style insights** for a fun read,
- and **reply suggestions** in three tones: soft, playful, and savage.

## What I built

I built a Next.js app focused on turning an emotionally messy user problem ("what does this text mean?") into a fast, fun, and actionable experience.

The product combines:
- a lively, Gen-Z-friendly interface,
- deterministic + AI-assisted analysis endpoints,
- staged reveal animations (loading -> drumroll -> result),
- and share-ready output users can post with friends.

## Demo

Live project: https://situationship-radar.vercel.app/

Suggested flow:
1. Paste a chat/situationship snippet.
2. Click analyze.
3. Review the Delulu score, signal bars, meme insights, and suggested replies.
4. Copy/share your favorite response style.

## How I used TRAE to build it

I used TRAE as a rapid build partner across product, code, and polish:

- **Ideation to UI structure**: used TRAE prompts to quickly shape component architecture (hero, input card, reveal sequence, score + signals + suggestions).
- **Iteration speed**: used TRAE to refactor copy tone and interaction flow so the app feels witty but still useful.
- **Feature scaffolding**: used TRAE to draft API route logic and fallback behavior for resilient scoring/insight generation.
- **UX polish**: used TRAE to tighten microcopy, loading states, and emotional tone so results feel entertaining, not clinical.
